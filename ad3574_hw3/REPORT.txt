The execution time for Q5 was under 20 secs on my machine.
After running the eval_parser3 on the prediction file of Q5, I got an F1 score of 71.4
I found the precision and F1 score of VP and NP to be on the lower side. Maybe this was due to the train corpus.


The execution time for Q6 was under 30 secs on my machine
After running the eval_parser3 on the prediction file of Q6, I got an F1 score of 74.2
With vertical markovization, the set of non terminals increased a lot, but however, the dynamic programming
and back pointers helped greatly in the execution of the program in a reasonable amount of time.
Also, a use of Dictionary in python helped a lot in execution time.
The precision and F1 score of VP and NP also increased compared to Q5, so we can say that
vertical markovization helped the parser.
Almost all performance improved as compared to Q5, but however, the performance for
NP+ADJ decreased.
